# My Next.js and Express Project

## Project Structure

This project is a simple boilerplate for a Next.js application with an integrated Express backend. Here's an overview of the project structure:

my-nextjs-app/
│
├── pages/ # Frontend React components and pages
│ └── index.js # Sample Next.js page
│
├── server_tests/ # Server-side tests
│ └── server.test.js # Tests for the Express server
│
├── server.js # Express server setup
│
├── package.json # Project dependencies and scripts
│
└── README.md # Documentation (you are here)

## Running Frontend Tests

To run tests for the frontend components and pages, you can use the following command:

```npm test```

This command will execute the Jest tests located in the __tests__ directory.

## Running Server Tests
To run tests for the server-side code in server.js, use the following command:

```npm run server-test```

This command will execute the Jest tests located in the __server_tests__ directory.

Please note that this is a basic setup. You can expand and customize it as needed for your project.

# Getting Started
To run the project locally, you can use the following commands:

## Running Frontend
```npm run dev``` 

## Running Server

```npm run dev:server```

This will launch the Next.js frontend and the Express server.


This is a basic README structure. You can add more details, such as how to deploy the application or how to set up environment variables, depending on your project's requirements.
